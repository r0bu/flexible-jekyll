Erm, hello, how are you? 

It's a strange thing, having NEVER blogged before, to know what to write as an introduction, especially when you don't know who your audience are - or even if you have one?! But, I've come this far, and believe me, it's been a ballache to get to this point, so I'm not about stop now. Incidentally, anyone wishing to use Jekyll on Windows/WSL should promptly ignore Jekyll's own instructions for installing on Windows. Do yourself a favour, use WSL2 and follow the Ubuntu instructions - it just works!

### So, why start blogging now?

I have about a 22 (maybe 23) year history of working in IT, from service desk (pretty sure they said helpdesk back then) through to IT management and most things in between. Then about 18 months ago I decided I wanted a more specific focus, and with a bit more exposure to the bleeding edge stuff. I've always focussed on Microsoft on-premises products and technology, I'm a firm advocate of moving as many workloads to the cloud as possible. So Microsoft 365 technologies; Office 365 & EM+S became my subject of choice. It wasn't like I was coming in cold either, I'd been using Office 365 since it's Live@Edu days, and had plenty of exposure to E5-level functionality.
